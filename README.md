## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide template code to support each stage of the 'standard' data science pipeline.



## Stages of the pipeline:

### Step 1: Set up repository

Recommended structure: [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) as starting point, modified based on requirements.

Core suggested folders are the following:
- data
- models
- notebooks
- src


### Step 2: Understand the data

Questions to answer:
- What type of data do we have here?
- What is the quality of the data? (E.g. How many missing variables?)
- What kind of task is this? What kind of models might be appropriate?

Template code to help wth this analysis is available in [this notebook](1.%20Initial%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb).
